        	<ul>
        		<li>In a world where design tools are more accessible with easier features to achieve great designs, it has been discovered that a lot of users still find it difficult to do it right simply because they lack the basic knowledge of design; having the tool is not as important as using it right.</li>
        		<li>It is very evident that design is required in almost, if not all fields of endeavors in life and an individual without any formal or informal knowledge of design will find it difficult to interact or deliver excellently.</li>
        		<li>The society at large is over-saturated with poor designs so much that good designs are hardly appreciated nor understood.</li>

        <div class="down-3 xs-down-1"><span class="faded">Design goes to School is an initiative set to educate senior secondary school students both in private and government schools about the basic design theories, the importance of design, its relevance to daily life and how it influences choices and decision-making from the secondary level of education. We are not instigating that every student should end up as a designer, this only assists in preparing the youngsters for life in the tertiary institutions and beyond.
		
		<div class="down-1 xs-down-1">Designers have a special skill-set which enables them to think through rather horrifying challenges, like the educational system. Designers can also be referred to as problem solvers as they can spot problems that are not visible to the naked eyes. They are highly imaginative, and Education is one of the many avenues where their talents are mostly required because alteration to any system must begin at the point of entry. Moreover, it is no longer news that the educational system plays a major role in feeding any individual with information for either transformation or degradation.</div>
